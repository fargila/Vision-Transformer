# üß† Vision Transformer (ViT) - Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model from scratch using PyTorch. Inspired by the transformer architecture originally designed for natural language processing, ViT applies self-attention mechanisms to image patches, offering a powerful alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## üì∏ What Is a Vision Transformer?

Instead of processing entire images with convolutions, Vision Transformers:
- Divide images into fixed-size patches
- Flatten and embed each patch into a vector
- Add positional encodings to retain spatial context
- Pass the sequence of patch embeddings through transformer encoder blocks
- Use a classification token (`[CLS]`) to predict image labels

## üöÄ Features

- Patch embedding layer
- Multi-head self-attention
- Positional encoding
- Transformer encoder blocks
- Classification head
- Optional training loop for datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST

## üìä DataSet

You can modify the notebook to use datasets like:
- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

These are available via torchvsion.datasets
